I love to be a software engineer; my job allows me to build huge things using just a laptop, anywhere in the world.

Personally, I don’t differentiate between _front-end_ and _back-end_: I feel comfortable doing both - although lately, I’m having a good time building reactive front-ends using technologies like [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Riot.js](https://riot.js.org/), and, of course, [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/).

On the back-end, I’m experienced in Java (Spring MVC, Boot), PHP (Magento, WordPress), and Python (Flask).
