I've always been the _paper and pen_ type. Addicted to stationery items, my desk was always a mess, full of post-its, pens, notebooks, markers... You name it. I wasn't finding the perfect organization method for taking notes in meetings, conferences, etc. and then being able to read them later in a convenient way. I started lots of notebooks and systems, like Hipster PDA or bullet journal, but after a coupleof days I always gave up. Last year I started using [Pretext](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pretext/id1347707000) for writing notes and synchronizing them through my cloud service. That was very handy because I could search them easily, but I still felt handcuffed when trying to use it in meetings or conferences since I couldn't draw lines, arrows or any symbol easily. So I gave up again and continued using notebooks at work.

Some weeks ago I found on Reddit [Why the N.Y.P.D. Dropped One of Its Oldest Crime-Fighting Tools](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/nyregion/nypd-memo-book.html) describing how the NYPD achieved what I couldn't. Also, a few days later, [Enrique Dans](https://enriquedans.com), wrote about this and said [something that caught my attention](https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2020/02/10/digital-transformation-is-happening-in-our-policeforces/):

> why scroll through old note books trying to find something from a meeting six months ago, when that information would be immediately accessible and legible if you'd saved it on your smartphone, computer or iPad? And the reason youâ€™re so slow at writing on those devices is because you don't practice enough.

That thing about don't practicing enough made me try it again, but if I wanted to success I needed a different approach. Then, the last piece of the puzzle emerged. It was [this interview on Learning Legenario](https://learninglegendario.com/episodio-30-visual-thinking-y-formacion-con-lorena-estevez/) (in Spanish) to Lorena Estevez who explained different techniques of story telling using Visual Thinking. She mentioned how she takes notes using [mind maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nTuScU70As) and then I finally found what was left for switching my paper notebook to an app on my phone. The app was [Mindmeister](https://www.mindmeister.com), though later I switched to [Xmind](https://www.xmind.net) since it let me store the notes in my own cloud service instead of forcing me to having an account. I've been aware of my on-line data for 2 years, but that's another story :)

I started using Xmind in some meetings and I stopped having that classic feeling of losing sight while taking notes. After a week I wasn't carrying my paper notebook with me anymore, only my phone. Consequently I could search through my notes and share them in pdf or markdown to anybody right after the end of the meeting.
